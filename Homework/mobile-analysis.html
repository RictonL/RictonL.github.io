			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<!-- ***********************************************

You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
			<p>First of all, my phone sucks so I don't use it a whole lot. </p>

				<li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
				<li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
				<li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
				<li>Any frustrations?</li>

			</ul>

			<h2>Findings</h2>
			<!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
			<h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
			<p>It was difficuld to see what I wanted to on everysight except facebook. I usually just had to scrool and wait for it to load a lot./p>

			<h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
			<p>Yes, though It took longer. On some sights, like imleages and I-Learn, I just gave up.</p>

			<h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
			<p>No, I get frusterated with my slow phone and tell my girfriend to look it up. I had to do that with byui.edu.</p>

			<h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
			<p>Everything. I hate working on a tiny screen that only allows my to see one thing at a time. I like being able to switch between windows and tabs easily.</p>

			<h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
			<p>No, unless you count using the facebook application.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>That I hate using my phone. Nothing really suprised me. I use my computer for a reason.</p>

			<h2>List of sites</h2>
			<!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the user will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
